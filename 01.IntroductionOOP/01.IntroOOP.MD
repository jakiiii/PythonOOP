# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Developed in the 1960's (language called **Simulab67** and then later on **smalltalk**)
- A parading for code organization and design
- The OOP paradigm:
    - Organizes data into *object* and *functionality* into methods
    - Design object specification (data and methods) in classes (blueprint)
- Promote collaboration, code extension and maintenance
- The primary paradigm for software design worldwide


## Procedural Vs Object Paradigm

**Procedural Paradigm**
```
obj = 0
obj = increment(obj)
obj = increment(obj)
print (obj)     # 2

Example:
def increment(arg):
    arg = arg + 1
    return arg
```

**Object Paradigm**
```
obj = MyCustomInt()
obj.increment()
obj.increment()
print(obj)      # 2

Example:
class MyCustomInt(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.val = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.val = self.val + 1

    def __repr__(self):
        return str(self.val)
```
**obj** is a **MyCustomInt** object.

**Definition of object: a unit of data that has associated functionality.**


## Why OOP is Best Practice?

- OOP organizes code so it is:
    - Easier or use
    - Easier to understand
    - Easier to maintain and extend
    - Easier to collaborate
- Complexity must always to managed
- OOP is a universal paradigm (use to maximum language)
- Leaning OOP is a necessary next step into the larger world of software engineering.


## THREE PILLARS OF Object-Oriented Programming:
**1. Encapsulation**

**2. Inheritance**

**3. Polymorphism**

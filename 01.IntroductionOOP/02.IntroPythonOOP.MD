# Object-Oriented Python

- Everything is object in Python even number and including primitives.
- Others language empty primitives (non-object data)
- All entities in Python follow the same rules of objects.
    - Every object (instance of a class) has a type (the class)
    - The object or class has attributes, some of which are methods.

### What is in object?
*An object is an unit of data (having one or more attributes), of a praticular class or type, with associated functionality (methods).*

**Example:**
```
myInt = 1
myStr = 'Python'

print(type(myInt))
<class 'int'>

print(type(myStr))
<class 'str'>
```
